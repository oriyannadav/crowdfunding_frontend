## About

Welcome to Schoolr, the leading crowdfunding platform dedicated to making higher education accessible for all aspiring students! At Schoolr, our primary purpose is to bridge the financial gap and empower students who dream of pursuing higher education but face financial constraints. We understand the soaring costs of university tuition can be a significant hurdle for many students and their families. That's why we've created Schoolr, a platform that connects determined students with compassionate individuals, alumni, and organizations who believe in the transformative power of education. Our mission is to ensure that no deserving student is deprived of the opportunity to study at their dream university due to financial limitations. If you are a motivated student seeking to pursue higher education or a generous supporter who believes in the value of education, join Schoolr today and become part of a community that is shaping brighter futures and unlocking the potential of talented minds. Together, we can break down barriers and pave the way for a more equitable and educated world.
